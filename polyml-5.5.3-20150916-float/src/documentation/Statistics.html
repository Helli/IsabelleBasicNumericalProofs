<h2><font face="Arial"><strong>PolyML.Statistics structure</strong></font></h2>
<p>The PolyML.Statistics structure provides a way for a program to read information 
  about the run-time system. As well as getting information about the local Poly/ML 
  process it is also possible to get information about another Poly/ML process 
  being run by the same user.</p>
<PRE><STRONG>structure</STRONG> Statistics:
  <strong>sig</strong>
    <strong>val</strong> getLocalStats : unit ->
       {sizeHeap: int,

<p>There are two functions that return information..</p>
<PRE><STRONG>val</STRONG> getLocalStats : unit -&gt; { ... }</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> Returns information about the Poly/ML 
  process that has called this function.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><STRONG>val</STRONG> getRemoteStats : int -&gt; { ... }</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
  <p>Returns information about another Poly/ML process. The argument is the process 
    id (pid) of the Poly/ML process for which information is requested. Raises 
    the Fail exception if this is not a currently running Poly/ML process or the 
    calling user does not have permission to read the statistics. The statistics 
    are held in shared memory and on Unix systems these are memory-mapped files 
    in the user's .polyml directory.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The actual information returned is still being determined and may well change.</p>
<p>In addition to information about the run-time system the statistics mechanism 
  provides a small array of values that can be set by the ML code. This allows 
  an ML program to set values that can be read in another process.</p>
<PRE><STRONG>val</STRONG> numUserCounters : unit -&gt; int</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> Returns the number of counters available. 
  Currently this is eight.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><STRONG>val</STRONG> setUserCounter : int * int -> unit</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <p>setUserCounter(n, m) stores the value m in the n-th counter.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Writing to the counters is potentially an expensive operation. If the information 
  is likely to change rapidly it will usually be best to use a separate thread 
  to poll the information periodically and update the counter.</p>
