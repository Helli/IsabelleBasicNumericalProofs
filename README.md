# IsabelleBasicNumericalProof
A structured and commented overview of the work so far is at output/hellauerthesis.pdf.
The generating file Main_Thesis.thy is not recommended for working however: Some parts of the IEEE_Floating_Point theories are copied in instead of imported to enable easy citations. The code is therefore messy and possibly out-of-date.
This branch is now abandoned so that it always points to the session producing the thesis.
